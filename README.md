Fact:Ions
=========

A factions plugin by someone who does know about factions in pc at all.

##Introduction
In chemistry, we know that when an electron is lost, an atom becomes a cation. When an electron is gained, it becomes an anion. What about a server is added into MCPE? We call it Factions.

Yes. The fact is indeed that a computer is based on ions.

When Factions become a fact among the ions that run MCPE and PocketMine, we would find out that humans are reasonable to start wars for land.

Points to note:
* It is easy to start a faction, but if your faction's base is occupied, you will get banned for 15 minutes!
* You must have at least 3 people to start a faction.
* When all members of your faction is offline, your occupied chunks get automatically undestroyable.
* The number of chunks you may claim cannot be more than the number of members in your faction or 8. This rule may be cancelled in 0.9.0 update when infinite worlds are out.
