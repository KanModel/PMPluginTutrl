Introduction to PHP
===
This tutorial is made for people who already know Java or C/C++/Objective C.


Yes, JavaScript is okay too, but you must also know about the concept of a class. (If you don't, I will make a page for it later.

So, basically, PHP is the same as JavaScript except that it has "$" before all variables and that it has different methods of calling functions ($class ->
functionName() or ClassName::staticFunction() )

Also, built-in functions are different. Instead of Math::cos() we directly do cos(). Also, when calling functions in the same class, you need to do $this. ($this is a T-VARIABLE equivalent to this in Java)
